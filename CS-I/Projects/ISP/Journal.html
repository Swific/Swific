    <h3> Software Development Engineer <h3>
	<h4> Software engineers help and creates apps, operating systems, web applications, etc. They have an average pay of $89,000. They usually have a strong background of programming skills. I expect to be decent at it as I understand a good amount of swift but it may not be enough. As a result, I will attempt to understand and practice using Swift more.
	  <h3>QA Engineer</h3>
	  <h4> It is a job in which they find bugs and is their job to fix it usually before the release. They can be in automotive, medical, food/beverage industries. I am good at solving bugs by usually the print statements as a good way to check. However, I would need to understand the error messages better. </h4>
	  <h3> Project Manager </h3>
	  <h4> They lead the team to achieve project goals such as finishing developing a game with a deadline. They are important as they keep the team on track and on schedule. They also collab with their peers to work to plan and design a project. I think I would suit this somewhat. The only issue is with me not remembering due dates. I would solve this by having my own calender with due dates written down to help keep the group on track. </h4>
	  <h3> Product Manager </h3>
	  <h4> They go through a process of planning, developing, launching, and managing a product. They also connect to the customer's needs by prioritizing the requirements of products. I believe I fit this job somewhat too. Although I may encounter an issue with requirements, I will double check it before the product is finished.
	    <h3> Release Engineer </h3>
	    <h4> They define all the steps required for a software to be released. They also ensure the timely release of software for organizations. Additionally, they also create and execute programming scripts that are used for software creation. I think I may fit this role as I don't have too much experience with software creation. I can overcome this issue by understanding how softwares run and work. </h4>

	    <h2> Week 4 </h2>
	    <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	    <p> There are lots of errors in the merlin missions </p>
	    <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3>
	    <p> Not much done still but we might have an idea soon </p>
	    <h3> Interpersonal Challenges </h3>
	    <p> I had to go through and fix many bugs that resulted in errors. </p>
	    
	    <h2> Week 3 </h2>
	    <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	    <p> I had a slight bit of issue figuring out how to code "Hello, World!" in 12 diferent languages but I eventually figured it out </p>
	    <h3> Scheduling Challelenges </h3>
	    <p> Still not much work on the ISP. We are much more focused on quizzes and missions. </p>
	    <h3> Swift is being ingrained in my head which is beneficial for the ISP. </h3>
	    
	    <h2> Week 2</h2>
	    <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	    <p> I had an issue with understanding some of the questions that were about printing the powers of numbers. I solved the issue by first going to the coder merlin website and going to the specific merlin lesson. I figured out that I needed to use E to substitute out the 10^ in Swift. </p>
	    <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3>
	    <p> No one really had time this week to work on the ISP. We were more focused on working on the merlin missions and learning how to code in Swift. I can solve this problem by working at home more. </p>
	    <h3> Interpersonal Challenges </h3>
	    <p> Although I have a way better understand of the Swift programming language, there are still some parts that I struggle on. These include remembering the symbols such as OR, AND, REMAINDERS, etc. Some of the missions were also time consuming for me too. I overcame it by practicing more as it makes it easier to memorize unconsiously. </p>

	    <hr> </hr>
    <h2> Week 1</h2>
    <h3> Technical Challenges</h3>
    <p>There was a slight problem with figuring how to push to github. However, I eventually figured it out after a while. </p>
    <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3>
    <p> There wasn't much scheduling challenges except for figuring out who should do what. We are still deciding on what type of project to make for the ISP. I assume that we will make a fun game using the coding language swift.  </p>
    <h3> Interpersonal Challenges </h3>
	<p> It was pretty interesting to relearn the basics of swift again as a refresh of memory. I find it a bit challenging to remember the differences between swift and other programming languages.  </p>
