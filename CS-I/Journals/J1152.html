      <h2>1.1: Why is the test executed prior to the loop? <br> It needs to first check if it is greater than 4. If the test evaluates to false, then a jump is executed to the alternative otherwise it continues with the consequent.  </h2>
      <h2>1.2: Compare this diagram to that of the conditional. What are the similarities? What are the differences? <br> They are similiar in how it is structured but the diagram is visually easily to read while one is text based in assembly.  </h2>
