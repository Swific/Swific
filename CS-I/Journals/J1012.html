    <h2>I have recieved assistance from: Coder Merlin </h2>
    <h2>I assisted: NO ONE </h2>

    <h2>1.1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base. <br> Make sure to first align the addends vertically and flush right. If any digit has fewer digits than the maximum digit, add zeros to the left of the number while necessary. At last, add the numbers and carry over if it's above 9. </h2>
    <h2>2.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers? <br> The octal number line has to be used instead of the decimal system since there is no 8 or 9 for octal. </h2>
    <h2>3.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers? <br> The hexdecimal line has to be used since it has 16 digits but it's similiar to the decimal one. </h2>
    <h2>4.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers? <br> You have to remember that binary has 2 digits (0 and 1) and the position of the number. </h2>

    <h3> What did I learn? What is the "big idea"? </h3>
    <p> I learned how to add in decimal, octal, hexdecimal, and binary. The big idea is how it will be useful for future projects such as saving as much memory as possible.
    <h3> What challenges did I encounter? </h3>
    <p> The only challenged was figuring out the methods to add the 4 number systems. </p>
    <h3> How could this experience be improved? </h3>
    <p> There could be a much better way to explain how to add number systems. Some of the sentences made a little sense too. </p>
    <h3> Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking? </h3>
    I now think like a computer, as like if I am a computer. It has also made me understood how computers read.
