    <h2>I have recieved assistance from: Coder Merlin </h2>
    <h2>I assisted: NO ONE </h2>

    <h2>1.1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column? <br> I recognize the AND truth table.  </h2>
    <h2>1.2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column? <br> I recognize the XOR truth table. </h2>
    <h2>2.1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder? <br> The "S" output for the first-half of the full-adder are the same. </h2>
    <h2>2.2: Why is this true? <br> It is true because there are no carry ins for the first-half. </h2>
    <h2>3.1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder? <br> A half-adder is used because it does not require a third bit which is why a carry in is not needed. </h2>
    <h2>3.2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not? <br> No, because the sum of the inputs from the half-adder and full-adder have to be accounted for.</h2>
    <h2>3.3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called? <br> We can infer that that the calculated number is greater than the 16 bit interger. This state is commonly called the 16 bit interger limit. </h2>

    <h3> What did I learn? What is the "big idea"? </h3>
    <p> I learned about half and full adders. The big idea is how I can use this for future purposes. </p>
    <h3> What challenges did I encounter? </h3>
    <p> I had a slightly difficult challenge to figure out how to use them on the falstead editor.  </p>
    <h3> How could this experience be improved? </h3>
    <p> A more simplified explanation is needed first. </p>
    <h3> Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking? </h3>
    <p> It makes me wonder on how computers work more. </p>
