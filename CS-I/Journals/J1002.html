    <h2>I have recieved assistance from: Coder Merlin </h2>
    <h2>I assisted: NO ONE </h2>

    <h2>1.1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model <br> One of the other services that I use is Roblox Studio. <br> Another one of the services I use is Visual Studio Code. </h2>
    <h2>2.1: It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why? <br>  I think that the ability to have two different users is useful for organization so nothing gets jumbled up.  </h2>
    <h2>3.1: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it? <br> I think the tilde (~) represents the home directory (as our current directory) </h2>
    <h2>4.1: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful? <br>  Yes, it added in a directory called "Merlin" and it's useful for organizing things.  </h2>

    <h2>5.1: What happens each time you press the up arrow? <br> Pressing the up arrow recalls the previous command. </h2>
    <h2>5.2: What happens each time you press the down arrow? <br> Pressing the down arrow goes back to the command after the previous command. </h2>
    <h2>6.1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text? <br> No, because the output was redirected to another file. </h2>
    <h2>7.1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command? <br> The ls commands lists files and the tree command outputs a directory hierarchy tree. </h2>
    <h2>7.2: How do you choose to use one over the other? <br>  I would choose ls if I just need a quick list and tree if I need to figure out where a specific file is located. </h2>
    <h2>8.1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies? <br> The argument goes idle in the foreground.</h2>
    <h2>8.2: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How? <br> I am able to test it by counting the amount of seconds it "slept". </h2>
    <h2>9.1: How is the behavior different from what you expected? <br> I thought it was an argument for minutes but it was instead to run it in the background. </h2>
    <h2>9.2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background? <br> I think it means it will run even if im not directly on the window. </h2>
    <h2>9.3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies? <br>  It means the amount of time to wait. </h2>
    <h2>10.1: What do you observe as you execute the jobs command? <br>  It lists what is running. </h2>
    <h2>10.2: How do you explain your observations? <br> I would explain it as something that is running in the background. </h2>

    <h3> What did I learn? What is the "big idea"? </h3>
    <p> I learned about the tabby terminal and the basics of it. The big idea is how the basics of tabby can be used to do more complex things </p>
    <h3> What challenges did I encounter? </h3>
    <p> I encountered some trouble of figuring out how to use the chmod command. I also had trouble figuring out how to setup directories. </p>
    <h3> How could this experience be improved? </h3>
    <p> There should be a way for shortcuts to not be accidentally pressed on. Pressing on shortcuts accidentally has caused some problems related to random pop ups.</p>
    <h3> Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking? </h3>
    <p> I have learned a lot to be able to use Tabby for future classes. It is quite useful when using emacs.  </p>
