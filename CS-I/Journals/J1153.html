    <h2>1.1: Compare this behavior to that of the while loop. What are the similarities? What are the differences? <br> They are both preferably used to repeat lines of code more than one time. However, a repeat-while loop executes the defined statements and then the condition. So it will execute at least one line of code even if the condition is false. </h2>
    <h2>2.1: What are the minimum number of times that this loop will execute? <br> Once since the condition is not checked first. </h2>
    <h2>3.1: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent? <br> It is to go back to the condition in order to check it and see if it needs to run the lines of code again.  </h2>

    <h2>2.1: Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a while loop using a repeat-while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example. <br> Yes, an example of this is that you could add the equal sign in order to compensate for the repeat-while loop running it before the condition. </h2>
    <h2>2.2: Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a repeat-while loop using a while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example. <br> Yes, the repeat-while loop's equal sign could be removed in order to compensate for the while loop that checks the condition first. </h2>
