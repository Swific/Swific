      <h2>I have recieved assistance from: Coder Merlin </h2>
      <h2>I assisted: NO ONE </h2>

      <h2>1.1: How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior? <br> It gives more actions after the condition has passed.  </h2>
      <h2>1.2: Why do you think the term consequent is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the Boolean test evaluates to true? <br> Because the definition of consequent means following as a result or effect.  </h2>
      <h2>2.1: Why is the first Jump instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not? <br> The first jump is conditional since the alternatives comes first. </h2>
      <h2>2.2: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent? <br> So the consequent message can be printed. </h2>
      <h2>2.3: The corresponding jump instruction will move down to the next one. </h2>

      <h3> What did I learn? What is the "big idea"? </h3>
      <p> I learned about Jumps, consequent, flowchart, and many other symbols. </p>
      <h3> What challenges did I encounter? </h3>
      <p> It was really about understand the contents of the journal.  </p>
      <h3> How could this experience be improved? </h3>
      <p> A more simplified explanation is needed. </p>
      <h3> Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking? </h3>
      <p> It makes me understand how the assembly language works and how it is a higher level langauge. </p>
