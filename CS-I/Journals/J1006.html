    <h2>I assisted: NO ONE </h2>

    <h2>1.1: What is Git communicating to you? <br> It is telling me my github email, name, and the date. </h2>
    <h2>1.2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit? <br> Both show that a new file has been created. </h2>
    <h2>1.3: Why do you think this is? <br> It is because they relate to each other. </h2>
    <h2>2.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status? <br> File1.txt is modified and file2.txt is untracked. They are also both not staged for commit.  </h2>
    <h2>2.2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not? <br> They are not in the same section because file1.txt is modified and file2.txt is untracked. </h2>
    <h2>3.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status? <br> Both are in the same section. They are displayed as 'Changes to be committed'. </h2>
    <h2>3.2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed. <br> File1.txt is considered modified and file2.txt is considered to be a new file. </h2>
    <h2>4.1: How many files are listed as having been changed? <br> Two files are listed to be changed. </h2>
    <h2>4.2: What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed? <br> The specific difference is the cyan color line that represents @@ -1 +1,2 @@ for the first file and @@ -0,0 +1 @@ for the second file.  </h2>
    <h2>5.1: What does Git tell you has changed? Why? <br> Git shows nothing because it means that the command has successfully run if it goes silent. </h2>
