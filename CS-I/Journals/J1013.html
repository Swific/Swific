    <h2>I have recieved assistance from: Coder Merlin </h2>
    <h2>I assisted: NO ONE </h2>

    <h2>1.1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction =/? <br> The slash and the 3 horizontal lines means that it is "not equivalant" or "XOR" . </h2>
    <h2>2.1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n? <br> The formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table is related only to the number of inputs since the number of rows depends on the amount of inputs there are. The formula is 2^n since each variable can either be true or false (0 or 1) and there are also "n" inputs for the truth table.  </h2>

    <h3> What did I learn? What is the "big idea"? </h3>
    <p> I learned about truth tables and boolean algebra.  </p>
    <h3> What challenges did I encounter? </h3>
    <p> I encountered the problem with remembering how to solve a lot of the problems. It was also difficult to figure out what the symbols mean. </p>
    <h3> How could this experience be improved? </h3>
    <p> There could be a better way to explain truth tables, maybe more graphics. </p>
    <h3> Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking? </h3>
    <p> It has made me think even more as a computer. They simply don't think like how humans do. </p>
