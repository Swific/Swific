       <h2>The Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h2>
       <p class="indented-paragraph"> Recommendation algorithms are often used by social media platforms, streaming services, search engines, and web services. Their purpose is to provide a personalized experience for users by suggesting relevant items, content, or products. For instance, Moreover, there are two methods used to reach the point of suggesting relevant items which are content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. </p>
       <p class="indented-paragraph"> Content-based filtering are based on the data provided for a product. The algorithm searches for similiarites such as context and description and also accounts for the user's previous history. For instance, imagine a user clicking on a video about gaming. Since the algorithm also recognizes that the user has watched previous gaming videos before, it prompts a gaming related advertisement. However, the downside is that data is required in the product and it doesn't allow the user to get recommended by different items. </p>
       <p class="indented-paragraph"> Collaborative filtering are based only on previous interactions recorded between user and items to produce new recommendations. For instance, if both User A and User both watch a video about gaming and User A decides to watch another related gaming video, the algorithm will recommend that video to User B. Moreover, the more similiar videos both users watch, the higher the likely the videos will be recommended. Therefore, this makes the system more accurate and more effective from the new information. Additionally, this allows the user to get recommended by different items unlike the content-based filtering. </p>

       <h2>The Feedback Loop</h2>
       <p class="indented-paragraph"> This starts when the user is recommended an array of options to pick from. When the user makes a choice, it is given as new knowdledge to train the algorithm. As a result, this creates a feedback loop where the algorithm's output becomes a part of its input. This means that recommendations that are similiar to the choice made by the user is shown. For example, a brand new user is given a list of songs that have different generes. When the user ends up picking pop, it gives it to the algorithm and it decides to serve the user similar pop songs. However, this increases the effect of filter bubbles where the user is limited to the amount of songs to hear. This may eventually lead to the user leaving the music platform because the user got bored of listening to the same songs repeatedly while also simultaneously not serving anything fresh to the user. </p>

       <h2>Conspiracy Theories & Algorithmic Amplification </h2>
       <p class="indented-paragraph"> Conspiracy Theories are often engaging and sensational which causes high engagement metrics. This results in the algorithm boosting these conspriracy theories in order to maximize the time the user stays on the platform. This can potentially be dangerous as it could lead people to believe it. An example would be the Bermuda Triangle where many conspiracy theories were created. On YouTube, many Bermuda Triangle related videos were boosted to fill the user's curosity of conspriarcy theories in order to max out the user's engagement and therefore revenue. These videos would often attempt to storytell and connect "mysterious" points to convince the reader to believe what the video explains.  </p>

       <h2>Platform Incentives </h2>
       <p class="indented-paragraph"> Social media platforms have incentives to keep users on their platforms. This includes followers and monetization for creators while viewers get fresh content and entertainment. Consequently, controversial topics will often be boosted as they have high engagement which results in more revenue. A good example would be a controversial tweet that is followed by arguments in the comment section which drives up engagement since it keeps users on the platform. However, this could be detrimental as it tells the algorithm to promote more harmful and malicious content to the user. Although content is often moderated on social media platforms, it cannot simply be removed fast enough and it is not easy to detect. Therefore, users need to take what they view with a grain of salt in order to not believe in conspriacy theories. </p>

       <h2>Potential for Exploitation </h2>
       <p class="indented-paragraph"> Malicious people that understand how to exploit the algorithm by making high engagement content are able to promote conspiracy theories. Examples include clickbait thumbnails, capitalized titles, and controversial topics. Consequently, this allows extremist views and misinformation to spread to potentially millions of people. Someone could simply create a theory and back it up with storytelling that sounds compelling by using science terms and connecting mysterious events with each other. However, even if the information is confirmed to be true with credible sources, there may be information or context left out on purpose to make it beneficial for the malicious person. </p>
